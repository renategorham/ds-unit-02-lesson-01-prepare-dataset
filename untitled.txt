Now it's time to play with some data. You're going to work through the stages of model preparation we've covered in this lesson and write up each one. Keep a good record in a Jupyter notebook â€“ we'll come back to your features in a future model-building assignment on Least Squares Regression.

Using a dataset of your choice, select an outcome variable and then pick four or five other variables (one to two categorical, three to four continuous) to act as the basis for features. Explore the variables using the univariate and bivariate methods you've learned so far.

Next, based on what you learned via your data exploration, create ten new features. Explain the reasoning behind each one.

Finally, use filtering methods to select the five best features and justify your choices.

When you're done, submit a link to your work below.
